# Enterprise Task Manager

A modern, enterprise-grade task management application built with React 19, TypeScript, and advanced architectural patterns. This project demonstrates senior-level development practices including atomic design, repository patterns, comprehensive testing, and professional code standards.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern React 19**: Utilizing the latest React features and hooks
- **TypeScript 5.5+**: Strict type safety with enterprise-grade interfaces
- **Atomic Design Pattern**: Organized component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **Advanced State Management**: Custom hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Service layer, repository pattern, and business logic separation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 60+ tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Professional Standards**: ESLint configuration, strict TypeScript, and code quality tools
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern CSS techniques
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA attributes
- **Performance Optimized**: Memoization, lazy loading, and efficient re-renders

### Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access with localStorage implementation
- **Service Layer**: Separates business logic from UI components
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulates complex state logic and side effects
- **Atomic Design**: Scalable component architecture
- **Singleton Pattern**: Service instances for consistent state management
